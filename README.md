## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Node.js 23+
- pnpm
- SQLite3

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Hyperliquid Analytics Setup

First, set up and run the Hyperliquid analytics system:

1. Navigate to the hyperliquid directory:
   ```bash
   cd hyperliquid
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   ```

5. Start the background jobs (these need to be scheduled by the developer, e.g., via cron):
   ```bash
   python -m background_jobs.main_job
   python -m background_jobs.analysis_job
   python -m background_jobs.vault_job
   python -m background_jobs.sentiment_job
   ```

6. In a new terminal, start the API server:
   ```bash
   python -m api.analysis_api
   ```

The background jobs will continuously collect and analyze trading data, while the API server provides access to this data.

### 2. Frontend Agent Setup

After the Hyperliquid system is running, you can set up the front end:

1. Navigate to the frontendAgent directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontendAgent
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pnpm i
   ```

3. Build the project:
   ```bash
   pnpm build
   ```

4. Start frontendAgent:
   ```bash
   pnpm start --characters="./characters/HyperLiquidHelper.json"
   ```

5. In a new terminal, start the client:
   ```bash
   pnpm start:client
   ```
